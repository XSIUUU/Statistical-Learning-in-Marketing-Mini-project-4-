## üóÇ Project Structure  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project 1: Data Complexity Reduction  
**Objective**: Simplify customer survey data by reducing the number of variables related to lifestyle and perceptions into a smaller set of factors.  

**Data**: `data for project 1& 2.csv`  
- Contains demographic data, lifestyle variables, and perceptions of organic foods from 250 consumers.  

**Methods**:  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Identify significant factors.  
- **Factor Loadings**: Understand variable contributions to factors.

**Outputs**:  
- Reduced survey data into key factors to simplify analysis.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Project 2: Marketing Mix Analysis  
**Objective**: Identify the factors that drive **purchase intention (PI)** and **willingness-to-recommend (WTR)** and analyze their impact on different customer groups.  

**Data**: `data for project 1& 2.csv`  

**Methods**:  
- **Linear Regression**: Analyze relationships between survey factors and target variables.  
- **Interaction Analysis**: Test differences in high and low spending groups.  

**Outputs**:  
- Significant predictors for PI and WTR.  
- Insights into customer spending behavior.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Project 3: Marketing Dynamics  
**Objective**: Analyze the impact of **advertising** and **pricing** on Ixm√∏r's sales over time, while accounting for competitor actions.  

**Data**: `data for project 3.csv`  
- Contains weekly time-series data on sales, advertising, pricing, and competitor metrics over 207 weeks.  

**Methods**:  
- **Granger Causality Tests**: Identify lead-lag relationships.  
- **Vector Auto-Regression (VAR)**: Model dynamic interactions.  
- **Impulse Response Functions (IRF)**: Analyze long-term effects.  

**Outputs**:  
- Advertising has a **delayed effect** on sales.  
- Competitor pricing impacts sales immediately.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Project 4: Customer Segmentation  
**Objective**: Segment the market to identify key customer groups for organic sandwich spreads.  

**Data**: `data for project 4.csv`  
- Contains data on 500 respondents' demographics and preferences for sandwich spreads.  

**Methods**:  
- **Hierarchical Clustering (Ward's Method)** and **K-means Clustering**  
- **ANOVA**: Compare cluster differences.  
- **PCA Visualization**: Validate segment separation.  

**Outputs**:  
Identified **3 key segments**:  
1. üü¢ **Sustainability-Oriented**: Eco-conscious older individuals.  
2. üîµ **Foodies**: Younger women focused on taste.  
3. üü° **Quality Seekers**: Balanced focus on health and taste.
